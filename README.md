# <span style="color:purple" >Cybersecurity Home Lab</span>

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my cybersecurity home lab projects. These projects are a collection of hands-on experiments, labs and write-ups that I have built to explore a myriad of concepts related to networking and security.

Everything here runs in a self-contained environment (virtual machines, Docker and other lab setups), so that I can safely simulate attacks, defenses, and monitoring without touching production systems.
